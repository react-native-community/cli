# React Native CLI

Command line tools that ship with [`react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in form of the `@react-native-community/cli` package.

> It exposes `react-native` binary, so you can call `yarn react-native` or `npx react-native` directly from your project.

## Compatibility

Our release cycle is independent of `react-native`. We follow semver and here is the compatibility table:

| `@react-native-community/cli`                                    | `react-native` |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| ^2.0.0                                                           | ^0.60.0        |
| [^1.0.0](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/tree/1.x) | ^0.59.0        |

## About

This repository contains tools and helpers for React Native projects in form of a command line tool. There's been quite some confusion around that since the extraction from React Native core. Let's clear them up:

- There are currently two CLIs:
  - [`@react-native-community/cli`](./packages/cli) – **the one used directly by `react-native`**. That makes it a transitive dependency of your project.
  - [`react-native-cli`](./packages/global-cli) – an optional global convenience package, which is a proxy to [`@react-native-community/cli`](./packages/cli) and global installation helper. **Please consider it legacy, because it's not necessary anymore**.
- When we say "the CLI" we mean `@react-native-community/cli`.
- We update the CLI independently of React Native itself. Please see [how to use the latest version](#updating-the-cli).
- This is a monorepo to keep stuff organized.

We're actively working to make any indirections gone.

## Creating a new React Native project

There are two ways to start a React Native project.

### Using `npx` (_recommended_)

> Available since `react-native@0.60`

This method is preferred if you don't want to install global packages.

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp
```

### Using global CLI (_legacy_)

You'll need to install a global module [`react-native-cli`](./packages/global-cli) and follow instructions there.

> We strongly encourage you to **only use global `react-native-cli` for bootstrapping new projects**. Use local version for everything else.

You can find out more about init command from the [documentation](./docs/init.md)

## Usage in an existing React Native project

Once you're inside an existing project, a local `react-native` binary will be available for you to use. Feel free to use Yarn to call it directly.

Example running `start` command in terminal:

```sh
yarn react-native start
# or:
npx react-native start
# or
node ./node_modules/.bin/react-native start
```

You can also add npm scripts to call it with whichever package manager you use:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-native start"
  }
}
```

## Updating the CLI

Because we release independently of `react-native`, it happens that you may be locked on a version without fixes for bugs that affect you. Here's how to get it sorted:

1. If you use lock files (`yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) - find the `@react-native-community/cli` entry, remove it, run `yarn install` / `npm install` once again.
2. If you don't use lock files – remove `node_modules` and run `yarn install` / `npm install` again.
3. Run `yarn list @react-native-community/cli` or `npm list @react-native-community/cli` and verify you're on the latest version.

After performing these steps you should be on the latest CLI version. Feel free to do it once in a while, because we release often.
