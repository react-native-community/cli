# React Native CLI

Command line tools that ship with [`react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in form of the `@react-native-community/cli` package.

> It exposes `react-native` binary, so you can call `yarn react-native` or `npx react-native` directly from your project.

## About

This repository contains tools and helpers for React Native projects in form of a command line tool. There's been quite some confusion around that since the extraction from React Native core. Let's clear them up:

- There are currently two CLIs:
  - [`@react-native-community/cli`](./packages/cli) – **the one used directly by `react-native`**. That makes it a transitive dependency of your project.
  - [`react-native-cli`](./packages/global-cli) – an optional global convenience package, which is a proxy to [`@react-native-community/cli`](./packages/cli) and global installation helper. **Please consider it legacy, because it's not necessary anymore**.
- When we say "the CLI" we mean `@react-native-community/cli`.
- We update the CLI independently of React Native itself. Please see [how to use the latest version](#updating-the-cli).
- This is a monorepo to keep stuff organized.

We're actively working to make any indirections gone.

## Creating a new React Native project

There are two ways to start a React Native project.

### Using `npx` (_recommended_)

> Available since `react-native@0.60`

This method is preferred if you don't want to install global packages.

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp
```

## Usage in an existing React Native project

Once you're inside an existing project, a local `react-native` binary will be available for you to use. Feel free to use Yarn to call it directly.

Example running `start` command in terminal:

```sh
yarn react-native start
# or:
npx react-native start
# or
node ./node_modules/.bin/react-native start
```

You can also add npm scripts to call it with whichever package manager you use:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-native start"
  }
}
```

## Updating the CLI

React Native CLI is a dependency of `react-native`, which makes it a transitive dependency of your project. It happens that you may be locked on a version without fixes for bugs that may affect you. Here's how to get it sorted:

1. If you use lock files (`yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) - find all the `@react-native-community/cli` prefixed entries, remove them, run `yarn install` / `npm install` once again.
   Here's an example using `yarn.lock`. Notice how _whole `@react-native-community/cli` entries_ are removed. Make sure to delete all of them:

   ```diff
   diff --git a/yarn.lock b/yarn.lock
   index 073309f..0bb8c4b 100644
   --- a/yarn.lock
   +++ b/yarn.lock

   -  dependencies:
   -    "@react-native-community/cli-tools" "^3.0.0"
   -    chalk "^2.4.2"
   ```

2. If you don't use lock files – remove `node_modules` and run `yarn install` / `npm install` again.
3. Run `yarn list --pattern @react-native-community/cli` or `npm list @react-native-community/cli` and verify you're on the latest version.

After performing these steps you should be on the latest CLI version. Feel free to do it once in a while, because we release often.
