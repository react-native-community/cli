# React Native CLI

Command line tools that ship with [`react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in form of the `@react-native-community/cli` package.

> It exposes `react-native` binary, so you can call `yarn react-native` or `npx react-native` directly from your project.

## About

This monorepository contains tools and helpers for React Native projects in form of a Command Line Tool (or CLI). This CLI is used directly by the `react-native` package and is not intended for use directly. We update it independently of React Native itself.

## Creating a new React Native project

Run the following command in your terminal prompt:

```sh
npx react-native@latest init MyApp
```

## Usage in an existing React Native project

Once you're inside an existing project, a local `react-native` binary will be available for you to use. Feel free to use Yarn to call it directly.

Example running `start` command in terminal:

```sh
yarn react-native start
# or:
npx react-native start
```

You can also add npm scripts to call it with whichever package manager you use:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-native start"
  }
}
```

## Updating the CLI

> [!WARNING]
> Please do it only if you need to. We don't recommend updating CLI independently of `react-native` as it may cause unexpected issues.

React Native CLI is a dependency of `react-native`, which makes it a transitive dependency of your project. You can overwrite the version independently of `react-native` by using `resolutions` field in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "@react-native-community/cli": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-clean": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-config": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-debugger-ui": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-doctor": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-platform-android": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-server-api": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-tools": "VERSION",
    "@react-native-community/cli-types": "VERSION"
  }
}
```
