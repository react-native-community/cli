# Configuration

React Native CLI has a configuration mechanism that allows changing its behavior and providing additional features.

> Note: Configuring CLI used to be possible via `rn-cli.config.js` (that has been renamed to `metro.config.js`) and never documented `rnpm` entry on the `package.json`. We have provided migration guides where possible.

React Native CLI can be configured by creating a `react-native.config.js` at the root of the project. Depending on the type of a package, the set of valid properties is different.

Check the documentation for

- [projects](./projects.md)
- [dependencies](./dependencies.md)
- [platforms](./platforms.md)
- [plugins](./plugins.md)

to learn more about different types of configuration and features available.
