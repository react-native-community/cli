# Project

A project is an app that contains React code and has a dependency on `react-native`.

Projects can provide additional properties to alter the CLI behavior, such as custom location of React Native files (this is useful when running RNTester from source) or a non-standard location of a project (useful when working in a brownfield app).

## How does it work?

A project can define a `react-native.config.js` at the root with custom configuration to be picked up by the CLI.

For example, below configuration informs CLI about a source directory with iOS files.

```js
module.exports = {
  project: {
    ios: {
      sourceDir: './custom-ios-location',
    },
  },
};
```

> Note: You may find this useful in scenarios where multiple `Podfile` files are present and CLI chooses the wrong one. When that happens, CLI will print a warning asking you to verify its selection.

You can check all available options below.

## Project interface

```ts
type ProjectConfigT = {
  reactNativePath: ?string;
  project: {
    android?: AndroidProjectParams;
    ios?: IOSProjectParams;
    // Any additional platforms would appear here
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  platforms: {
    android: AndroidPlatformConfig;
    ios: IOSPlatformConfig;
    // Any additional platforms would appear here
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  dependencies: {
    [key: string]: DependencyConfig;
  };
  commands: Command[];
};
```

### reactNativePath

A custom path to React Native, in case `require('react-native')` would throw. Useful when running
React Native from a (custom) source.

### project

A map of specific settings that can be set per platform. The exact shape is always defined by the package that provides given platform.

In most cases, as a React Native developer, you should not need to define any of these.

The following settings are available on iOS and Android:

```ts
type IOSProjectParams = {
  sourceDir?: string;
  watchModeCommandParams?: string[];
  unstable_reactLegacyComponentNames?: string[] | null;
};

type AndroidProjectParams = {
  sourceDir?: string;
  appName?: string;
  manifestPath?: string;
  packageName?: string;
  dependencyConfiguration?: string;
  watchModeCommandParams?: string[];
  unstable_reactLegacyComponentNames?: string[] | null;
};
```

#### project.ios.sourceDir

A path to a directory where iOS source files are located. In most cases, you shouldn't need to set it, unless you have
multiple `Podfile` files in your project.

#### project.ios.watchModeCommandParams

Array of strings that will be passed to the `npx react-native run-ios` command when running in watch mode.

#### project.ios.unstable_reactLegacyComponentNames

> Note: Only applicable when new architecture is turned on.

Please note that this is part of the **Unstable Fabric Interop Layer**, and might be subject to breaking change in the future,
hence the `unstable_` prefix.

An array with a list of Legacy Component Name that you want to be registered with the Fabric Interop Layer.
This will allow you to use libraries that haven't been migrated yet on the New Architecture.

The list should contain the name of the components, as they're registered in the ViewManagers (i.e. just `"Button"`).

#### project.android.appName

A name of the app in the Android `sourceDir`, equivalent to Gradle project name. By default it's `app`.

#### project.android.sourceDir

See [`dependency.platforms.android.sourceDir`](dependencies.md#platformsandroidsourcedir)

#### project.android.manifestPath

See [`dependency.platforms.android.manifestPath`](dependencies.md#platformsandroidmanifestpath)

#### project.android.packageName

See [`dependency.platforms.android.packageName`](dependencies.md#platformsandroidpackagename)

#### project.android.dependencyConfiguration

See [`dependency.platforms.android.configuration`](dependencies.md#platformsandroiddependencyconfiguration)

#### project.android.watchModeCommandParams

Array of strings that will be passed to the `npx react-native run-android` command when running in watch mode.

#### project.android.unstable_reactLegacyComponentNames

> Note: Only applicable when new architecture is turned on.

Please note that this is part of the **Unstable Fabric Interop Layer**, and might be subject to breaking change in the future,
hence the `unstable_` prefix.

An array with a list of Legacy Component Name that you want to be registered with the Fabric Interop Layer.
This will allow you to use libraries that haven't been migrated yet on the New Architecture.

The list should contain the name of the components, as they're registered in the ViewManagers (i.e. just `"Button"`).

### platforms

A object with platforms defined inside a project. You can check the format and options available [`here`](platforms.md#platform-interface)

### commands

An array of commands defined inside a project. You can check the format and options available [`here`](plugins.md#command-interface)

### dependencies

Dependencies is a map where key is the name of the dependency and value is an object that can override any of the resolved settings for a particular package.

For example, you could set:

```js
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    'react-native-webview': {
      platforms: {
        ios: null,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

in order to disable linking of React Native WebView on iOS.

or you could set:

```js
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    'react-native-brownfield': {
      platforms: {
        android: {
          dependencyConfiguration:
            'embed project(path: ":react-native-brownfield-bridge", configuration: "default")',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

in order to use something else than `implementation` _(default scope method)_

Another use-case would be supporting local libraries that are not discoverable for autolinking, since they're not part of your `dependencies` or `devDependencies`:

```js
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    'local-rn-library': {
      root: '/root/libraries',
    },
  },
};
```

The object provided here is deep merged with the dependency config. Check [`projectConfig`](platforms.md#projectconfig) and [`dependencyConfig`](platforms.md#dependencyConfig) return values for a full list of properties that you can override.

> Note: This is an advanced feature and you should not need to use it most of the time.
