# @react-native-community/cli-platform-ios

This package is part of the [React Native CLI](../../README.md). It contains commands for managing iOS part of React Native app.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @react-native-community/cli-platform-ios
```

## Commands

### `run-ios`

Usage:

```sh
react-native run-ios [options]
```

Builds your app and starts it on iOS simulator.

#### Options

#### `--simulator <simulator_name>`

> default: iPhone 14

Explicitly set the simulator to use. Optionally include iOS version between parenthesis at the end to match an exact version, e.g. `"iPhone 6 (10.0)"`.

Notes: If selected simulator does not exist, cli will try to run fallback simulators in following order:

- `iPhone 14`
- `iPhone 13`
- `iPhone 12`
- `iPhone 11`

Notes: `simulator_name` must be a valid iOS simulator name. If in doubt, open your AwesomeApp/ios/AwesomeApp.xcodeproj folder on XCode and unroll the dropdown menu containing the simulator list. The dropdown menu is situated on the right hand side of the play button (top left corner).

Example: this will launch your project directly onto the iPhone 14 simulator:

```sh
react-native run-ios --simulator "iPhone 14"
```

#### `--configuration <string>`
